Known bugs

June 9th, 2001
- Copying & pasting large amounts of data is unbelievably slow
  when compared with other hex editors.

November 19th, 2000
- Pasting data of CF_UNICODETEXT format doesn't work with translation off
  - this will be fixed sometime.
- Pasting data of formats other than CF_DSPTEXT, CF_OEMTEXT, CF_TEXT or
  CF_UNICODETEXT will append null bytes or garbage to the end of the data.
  This will probably never be fixed because of Windows, GlobalAlloc & GlobalSize
  unless the source to Windows is released (heah right) or someone sends me a kludge

- Cannot insert files of >~2Gb in size
  - probably couldn't anyway because of mem issues .'. this may never be fixed
   (until 64bit processors become standard. IMHO AMD's strategy is much better)

August 31st, 2000
- When replacing a very large number of occurances with data smaller
  or larger in size than the original, the execution time rises
  rapidly into untolerable ranges (due to an inefficient algorithm).
  Possible fix may be to resize the DataArray only once since allocs take so long.
